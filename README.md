# ruby_adventure
A short text game as an playground in Ruby. 

To play pull the repo. 
```
chmod +x game.rb
```

You will need a gem installed. On mac:
```
gem install highline
```

Then to run the game:
```
./game.rb
```

Good luck. Have fun. I will happily paypal anyone who wins on level 10 $1

# Contributing
Currently I am looking for some additions:
1. More verbose text about where a user is. 
2. A refactor so as to not repeatedly calculate a location type on the fly (DRY it  up)
3. Whatever you want. I will merge any reasonable PR.
